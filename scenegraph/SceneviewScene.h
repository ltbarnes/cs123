/**
 *
 * @class SceneviewScene
 *
 * A complex scene consisting of multiple objects. Students will implement this class in the
 * Sceneview assignment.
 *
 * Here you will implement your scene graph. The structure is up to you - feel free to create new
 * classes and data structures as you see fit. We are providing this SceneviewScene class for you
 * to use as a stencil if you like.
 *
 * Keep in mind that you'll also be rendering entire scenes in the next two assignments, Intersect
 * and Ray. The difference between this assignment and those that follow is here, we are using
 * OpenGL to do the rendering. In Intersect and Ray, you will be responsible for that.
